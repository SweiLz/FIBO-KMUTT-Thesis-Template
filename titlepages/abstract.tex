This thesis takes its basis on the Poppy Project, an open-source, 3D printed humanoid
robotic platform, with the aim to become more affordable for the research community.
So, a new design is required as well as providing all the knowledge to produce, control
and experiment with a biped platform in real world. The new design is driven by the
following objectives:
• Break the idea about the high cost of humanoid robot platforms.
• Reduce the complexity of 3D printed parts to be printed with any 3D printing
technology.
• Get closer bipedal walking to any enthusiastic of robotics.
• Compatible with cutting edge software used nowadays.
In order to design and implement this new platform it was necessary to develop all the
technological features of the robot (i.e. mechanics, assemble phase, electronics, software).
Similarly to the original project, all the parts in this project are accessible following the
open-source spirit and it becomes easy to be used due to the included libraries.
The new platform has been named Poppy UPC, a bipedal robot that keeps human
proportions. The 6 degrees of freedom per leg provides a full control of the pose and
orientation of each foot. To work comfortably, all the tools to control the robot has been
developed using the ROS framework, which fits for bipedal walking algorithms.
